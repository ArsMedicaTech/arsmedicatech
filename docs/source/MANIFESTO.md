# ArsMedicaTech Manifesto

> *Putting patients in command of their data, their decisions, and their destiny.*

## 1. Patient Autonomy

Healthcare software must **serve** patients, not extract from them.  We design features that respect consent, foster understanding, and hand control back to individuals.

## 2. Radical Transparency

Algorithms that influence care must be inspectable.  Source code, clinical rules, and data flows are open for audit under AGPLv3.

## 3. Privacy by Architecture

We minimise data collection, encrypt at rest and in transit, and expose all access logs to the data subjects themselves.

## 4. Commons over Enclosure

Knowledge about the body belongs to everyone.  Predatory forks that wall off features or inflate costs contradict our purpose - we rely on copyleft to keep the commons whole.

## 5. Sustainability, Not Hyper-Growth

Our revenue target is **break-even + modest maintainer wages**.  We reject business models that prioritise shareholder value over patient welfare.

We invite every clinician, developer, and patient to uphold these principles and iterate on them as the project grows.
