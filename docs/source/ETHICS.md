# ArsMedicaTech Ethical Guidelines

These rules are *in addition* to legal obligations (HIPAA, GDPR, PIPEDA, etc.).

| Principle | Practical Rule |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Beneficence** | Features must demonstrably improve or inform patient well-being. |
| **Non-Maleficence** | Absolutely no support for discrimination, denial of care, or surveillance beyond direct clinical context. |
| **Informed Consent** | Users can export, delete, or opt-out of data collection at any time. |
| **Right to Audit** | All code that processes identifiable health data is AGPL-licensed and repo-visible. |
| **Equitable Access** | Pricing (if any) must remain affordable in low-resource settings.  We encourage hosting community instances. |
| **Research Integrity** | Any ML/AI module must declare training data provenance and publish benchmark limitations. |
| **Transparency of Monetization** | Funding flows are published annually (see `DONATE.md`). |
