### LLM Tool-Calling Integration

**Prompt Router / Engine**: This is a preprocessing step or plugin system that selects which tools the LLM should call, based on structured patterns or keywords.

**Decision Tree Tool**: Ensures deterministic logic for certain clinical reasoning paths — important for trust and auditability.

**External APIs**:
* **NCBI**: Literature searches (PubMed, etc.).
* **clinicaltrials.gov**: Active and historical clinical trials.
* **medlineplus.gov**: Government-reviewed patient-facing medical info.

**SurrealDB as Vector Store**: RAG queries for internal or private documents with embeddings.

## Messaging

### Notifications

Live updates and notifications are handled using SSE (Server-Sent Events) via Redis for a PubSub queue.

| Event Type              | Payload Example                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `new_message`           | `{ type: 'new_message', conversationId: '123', sender: 'provider', content: 'Hello!' }` |
| `system_notification`   | `{ type: 'system_notification', content: 'Your profile is incomplete' }`       |
| `appointment_reminder` | `{ type: 'appointment_reminder', appointmentId: '456', time: '2025-02-20T10:00:00Z' }` |

### Usage

To notify users when a new message is saved, you can implement a function that publishes an event to the Redis PubSub queue. This function should be called after successfully saving the message in the database.

```python
def notify_on_message_save(msg, recipient):
    # After storing the message successfully
    if success and msg_obj:
        event = {
            "type": "new_message",
            "conversation_id": conversation_id,
            "sender": "Dr. Smith",  # Or look up sender
            "text": message_text,
            "timestamp": str(msg_obj.created_at)
        }
        # Notify recipient
        for participant_id in conversation.participant_ids:
            if participant_id != current_user_id:
                publish_event(participant_id, event)
```

```python
def send_appointment_reminder():
    publish_event(user_id=42, event_data={
        "type": "appointment_reminder",
        "time": "2025-07-11T10:00:00Z",
        "content": "Annual checkup"
    })
```

### Running Redis Locally

To run Redis locally, you can use Docker:

```bash
docker run --name redis -d -p 6379:6379 redis:latest
```

Then, you can connect to it using a Redis client library in your application.

### Testing

`{USER_ID}` is the user ID of the recipient, which can be obtained from your user management system or database.

It looks something like `User:8jz38zk55xaboplbo9at`.

```shell
# Send a test message
python test/send_notification.py {USER_ID} new_message "Hello from CLI!"

# Send an appointment reminder
python test/send_notification.py {USER_ID} appointment_reminder "Your appointment is tomorrow"

# Send a system notification
python test/send_notification.py {USER_ID} system_notification "System maintenance scheduled"
```

## How to Use

TBD...

### Webpack devServer vs Webpack build vs No Webpack...?

`webpack serve --config ./webpack.config.js --mode development --port 3010`

vs...

`npm start ./src/index.js`

`npm start ./src/index.js --port=3010 --proxy=http://127.0.0.1:5010`

## Databases

### SurrealDB

#### Connecting Remotely

1. Expose a port forward route: `kubectl port-forward service/surrealdb 8000:8000 -n arsmedicatech`.
2. Then, you can connect however you choose, for example by using the Surrealist UI desktop application.

#### ICD

Example: `section111validicd10-jan2025_0.csv`:
```csv
CODE,SHORT DESCRIPTION (VALID ICD-10 FY2025),LONG DESCRIPTION (VALID ICD-10 FY2025)
A000,"Cholera due to Vibrio cholerae 01, biovar cholerae","Cholera due to Vibrio cholerae 01, biovar cholerae"
A001,"Cholera due to Vibrio cholerae 01, biovar eltor","Cholera due to Vibrio cholerae 01, biovar eltor"
A009,"Cholera, unspecified","Cholera, unspecified"
A0100,"Typhoid fever, unspecified","Typhoid fever, unspecified"
A0101,Typhoid meningitis,Typhoid meningitis
```

#### Graph

We have added a graph database to our ecosystem.

For now, it just has some basic example nodes and relationships such as:
* `Diagnosis` -> `HAS_SYMPTOM` -> `Symptom`.
* `Medication` -> `TREATS` -> `Diagnosis`.
* `Symptom` -> `CONTRAINDICATED_FOR` -> `Medication`.
* `Medication` => `CONTRAINDICATED_FOR` => `Medication`.

Admittedly, it took me some time to start wrapping my head around the querying syntax for relationships, so I did not explore them as far as I would have liked to this time around.

I definitely plan on tackling some more complex use cases in the future as there is a lot of potential for that with graph databases.

Another caveat is that, currently as of this writing, a lot of the queries are a mix of standalone functions and use of our dedicated wrapper controller I started building out. I'd of course like that to be more consistent, but will return to that in the future.

##### Clinical Knowledge Graph (Graph Schema)

```mermaid
graph TD
    SY[Symptom]
    DX[Diagnosis]
    MED[Medication]
    TX[Treatment]
    SE[Side Effect]

    DX -- HAS_SYMPTOM --> SY
    MED -- TREATS --> DX
    SY -- CONTRAINDICATED_FOR --> MED
    MED -- CONTRAINDICATED_FOR --> MED
    TX -- TREATS --> DX
    MED -- CAUSES --> SE
```

##### Some Possible Future Direction to Explore

Add More Fields: You can store additional fields (e.g., `icd_code`, `description`, `severity`) on both node records and edge records.

Schema Definitions (Optional): SurrealDB allows schema definitions (`SCHEMAFULL`, `SCHEMALESS`) to enforce constraints if you want more structure.

Additional Node Types: Over time, you might add `Treatment` or `Procedure` nodes, or even `SideEffect` nodes.

Complex Edges: You could represent more nuanced relationships (e.g., “alleviates symptom,” “risk factor for,” “co-morbidity with,” etc.).

Integration with External Data: To fill out a large knowledge graph, you can look into open data sources:
* ICD-10/11 codes (WHO)
* UMLS Metathesaurus (NIH)
* SNOMED CT

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

### Usage

#### Inspector

1. Start a temporary port forward: `kubectl port-forward -n arsmedicatech service/mcp-server 9000:80`.
2. Run the inspector client: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@0.14.0`.
3. Navigate to the URL. Something like this: http://127.0.0.1:6274/#tools
4. Enter the URL: http://127.0.0.1:9000/mcp.
5. Click "Connect" to view the available tools.

## API Integrations

### Optimal

[Optimal](https://optimal.apphosting.services) is an API for mathematical optimization-as-a-service. It is actually another project of mine.

The use case implemented here is for individuals (patients or healthcare providers) to mathematically calculate an optimal diet for a particular condition. The first example provided is for managing hypertension.

## Documentation

To generate docs: `sphinx-apidoc -o docs/source/api lib`.
To build the docs: `sphinx-build -b html docs/source docs/_build/html`.

To test before build: `sphinx-build -v -b html docs docs/_build/html`.

### Some Notes on Edge Cases

I tried to limit my use of `# type: ignore` as much as possible, but I encountered a few edge cases that were more trouble than the static typing was worth (for the time being, at least).

Some of those cases:
* SurrealDB controller methods with ambiguous signatures.
* Flask `session` object.
* The `Faker` library.
* And a few other very isolated cases.

If time permits, I will return to these, but there is so much more value to be gained elsewhere.

As for `disable_error_code = no-any-return`, this one I will likely be returning to sooner than later.

## Extensions

You can add extensions to the project by creating a new directory under `plugins/` and implementing the required functionality.

There is an example plugin called `hello_world` that demonstrates how to create a simple Flask route.

As for frontend plugins, the feature is very experimental, but there is a mechanism in place.

Install Babel standalone: `npm install @babel/standalone`

You will need to transpile any JSX to JS first: `node plugins/jsx2js.js plugins/hello_world/js/index.jsx plugins/hello_world/js/index.js`
