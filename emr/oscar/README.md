## Migrations

#Warning: World-writable config file '/etc/mysql/conf.d/my.cnf' is ignored

```bash
docker-compose up -d db

# Copy the SQL files to the DB container
docker cp migrations/oscarinit.sql oscar-db:/oscarinit.sql
docker cp migrations/oscardata.sql oscar-db:/oscardata.sql
docker cp migrations/patch19.sql oscar-db:/patch19.sql

docker-compose exec db bash

# Then inside the DB container:
# OPTIONAL: mysql -u oscar -p'oscarpw' -e "DROP DATABASE oscar; CREATE DATABASE oscar;"
mysql -u oscar -p'oscarpw' oscar < /oscarinit.sql
mysql -u oscar -p'oscarpw' oscar < /oscardata.sql
